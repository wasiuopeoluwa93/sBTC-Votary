## Overview

**sBTC-Votary** is a governance smart contract written in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain. It enables a decentralized community to **create**, **vote**, **update**, **cancel**, and **execute** proposals. This governance system is designed for DAOs, community-led projects, and decentralized applications that require transparent and trustless decision-making processes.

* **Voting Duration Update**: Creators can extend or modify the duration of active proposals.

## üìã Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Creation** ‚Üí Creator submits a description and duration.
2. **Voting** ‚Üí Community votes within the specified timeframe.
3. **Execution** ‚Üí Proposal is passed if majority votes `for`.
4. **Final State** ‚Üí Proposal is marked as `executed`, `cancelled`, or remains `inactive`.

## üß™ Example Test Cases

* Proposal creation with zero duration ‚Üí ‚ùå Rejected.
* Voting after the voting window closes ‚Üí ‚ùå Rejected.
* Double voting ‚Üí ‚ùå Rejected.
* Successful proposal with more `for` than `against` ‚Üí ‚úÖ Executed.
